         How did you find the energy, Mom<br>
        To do all the things you did,<br>
        To be teacher, nurse and counselor<br>
        To me, when I was a kid.<br>
        How did you do it all, Mom
        Be a chauffeur, cook and friend?<br>
        Yet find time to be a playmate,<br>
        I just can&sbquo;t comprehend.<br>
        I see now it was love, Mom<br>
        That made you come whenever I&sbquo;d call,<br>
        Your inexhaustible love, Mom<br>
        And I thank you for it all.<br>
